Page Titles

What kind of metadata about the web page can the <head> element contain?

If you navigate to the main page of this repository and look at the top of your browser (or at the tab you have open), you'll 
notice the words Learn HTML - GitHub, which is the title of the web page.

The browser displays the title of the page because the title can be specified directly inside of the <head> element, by using a 
<title> tag.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Coding Journal</title>
  </head>
</html>

If we were to open a file containing the HTML code in the example above, the browser would display the words My Coding Journal in 
the title bar (or in the tab's title).
