Preparing for HTML

Great! Browsers that read your code will know to expect HTML when they attempt to read your file.

The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration is only the beginning, however. It indicates to the browser that you will use HTML in the document, but it 
doesn't actually add any HTML structure or content.

To create HTML structure and content, we must add opening and closing <html> tags, like so:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

</html>

Anything between the opening <html> and closing </html> tags will be interpreted as HTML code. Without these tags, it's possible that 
browsers could incorrectly interpret your HTML code.
