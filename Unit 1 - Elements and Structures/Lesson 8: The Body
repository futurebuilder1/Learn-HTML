The Body

We've added some HTML, but still haven't seen any results in the web browser to the right. Why is that?

Before we can add content that a browser will display, we have to add a body to the HTML file. Only content inside the opening and 
closing body tags can be displayed to the screen.

Once the file has a body, many different types of content – including text, images, and buttons – can be added to the body.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>I'm Learning To Code!</title>
  </head>
  <body>

  </body>
</html>

In the example above, the opening body tag (<body>) is placed directly below the closing head tag (</head>), and the closing body 
tag (</body>) is placed directly above the closing html tag (</html>).
