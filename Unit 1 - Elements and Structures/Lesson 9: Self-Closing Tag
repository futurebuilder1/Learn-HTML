Self-Closing Tag

Thus far we have only seen HTML elements with an opening and a closing tag. A few types of elements, however, require only one tag.

Self-closing elements contain all the information the browser needs to render the element inside a single tag. Also, because they 
are single tags, they cannot wrap around raw text or other elements.

The line break element <br /> is one example of a self-closing tag. You can use it anywhere within your HTML code. The result is a 
line break in the browser.

<p>line one<br />line two</p>

In the example above, the paragraph tags (<p>) enclose two phrases, split by a break tag (<br />). Note that single tags, unlike 
elements with two tags, can't wrap around raw text or other elements.

The code in the example above will result in an output that looks like the following:

line one
line two

Without the break tag, the browser would render line one and line two on the same line.
